A simple Webapp/Website named "Notage" consisting of a simple Notepad named CrazyNotes and an image gallary.

At first the website opens with homepage using index.html which contains all the necessary links for contact to the producer or any sufficient reason e.g. github, facebook, e-mail, linkedIn etc. And there are links to Home, CrazyNotes and Pictures in form of tabs.

Going to the "CrazyNotes" opens up a Notepad in which one can write down notes as much one wants and then clear the list using the button provided below.

Going to the "Pictures" tab opens up a huge mixed collection of images or image gallary based on every aspect of life such as technology, food, nature, music, education, sports etc.
